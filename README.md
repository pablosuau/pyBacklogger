# pyBackloggerA desktop Python application based on PyQ to manage your videogame collection <del>which includes data scraping from GameFAQs.com</del> based on [RAWG Video Game Database API](https://rawg.io/apidocs) and [rawgpy](https://pypi.org/project/rawgpy/). Contrary to GameFAQs, [RAWG](https://rawg.io/) is an open and rich data source. An additional advantage of using RAWG's API is that web scraping is not longer required. That makes pyBacklogger more robust and stable. ![Main window view](readme_img/main_window.png)Project's [post-mortem](https://github.com/pablosuau/pyBacklogger/blob/master/postmortem.md)'s document## How to use itYou just need need to run the following command:```python main.py```The buttons on the top bar, from left to right, correspond to the following commands:* **Add games**: games are added to your backlog by <del>scrapping data from GameFAQs.com</del> pulling data through RAWG's API. You can add one individual game by pasting the game's URL on RAWG's website or you can use the search function, with which you can add one or more games after searching games by name. Once a game is added to the backlog you can edit the year, change the status or add notes by clicking on the corresponding cell on the table. You can also add labels by selecting the corresponding cell. When introducing labels, commas are used to separate labels. * **Delete games**:  with this button you can delete the selected games. You can select one game by clicking on the game index on the left side of the window. You can select multiple games by using the Ctrl or Shift keys.* **Load backlog**: load your previously saved backlog.* **Save backlog**: saves your backlog into a file.* **Update ratings**: this option <del>lets you scrap GameFAQs</del> uses RAWG's API to update the rating and number of votes of the selected games (see the *delete games* option to see how to select games.) I'd recommend not to update more than 100 games per day.  * **Sort games**: with this option you can sort your backlog by any column or combination of columns, either in ascending or descending order. * **Statistics**: as it is expected, this option will show different statistics about your backlog, like for instance the percentage of finished games per system or per tag.* **Filter games**: filter out games based on different criteria, like tags, system or status. * **Search**: the search bar filters out all the games which name do not contain the string introduced. ## Weighted ratingsThe *Rating* and *Votes* columns, scrapped from GameFAQs.com, are used to calculate a *Weighted Rating* value for each games. This weighted rating is based on [IMDB's rating system]([https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/169032/understanding-the-imdb-weighted-rating-function-for-usage-on-my-own-website](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/169032/understanding-the-imdb-weighted-rating-function-for-usage-on-my-own-website)). The idea is to assign a high rating to games that not only have an average rating, but also many people voting for them. A higher number of votes provides more evidence about the real rating of a game. Therefore, all those games with a low number of votes have a weighted rating value that is very close to the average rating of your backlog.
